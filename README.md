# GitHubStreak

GitHubStreak is an open-source project that aims to rank developers based on their contributions to GitHub repositories and the number of consecutive days they have committed code (known as a "streak"). This project serves as a valuable tool for developers to showcase their commitment and activity on GitHub, and for potential employers or collaborators to identify dedicated and productive contributors.

## Features

- **Contribution Ranking**: Rank developers based on their activity on GitHub, including the number of commits, pull requests, and issues. The ranking system highlights top contributors and provides insights into their activity levels.

- **Streak Tracking**: Monitor and display the longest streak of consecutive days that a developer has committed code to their GitHub repositories. This feature helps track ongoing contributions and encourages consistent activity.

- **Leaderboard**: A dynamic leaderboard that showcases the top developers based on their contributions and streaks. This motivates developers to maintain high levels of activity and engage with the community.

- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles for each developer that include their contribution statistics, streak history, and additional relevant details. Profiles offer a deeper view into individual achievements and activity trends.

- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with the GitHub API to fetch and analyze developer data. This ensures accurate and up-to-date information is displayed, providing a reliable overview of contributions and activity.
